# v0.4.0-alpha.25
- Replaced the stretched `square02_001.png` Scale9 panel system with deterministic `CCLayerColor` panels. This removes the opaque black rectangles that could cover cards, LevelInfo UI, the vanilla progress bar, and gameplay percentage.
- Reduced the gameplay HUD footprint and moved the Ranked timer/state lower so Geometry Dash's native progress bar and percentage remain unobstructed.
- Shrunk the LevelInfo Ranked gate into a compact countdown/status strip while keeping the vanilla song acquisition controls as the only enabled inputs during preparation.
- Added client-observed `clientStartedAt` / `clientEndedAt` timestamps to Attempt transport using the synchronized server clock.
- Added a bounded 2-second server transport-reconciliation grace: gameplay deadlines are unchanged, but a Start packet observed before the deadline can still be accepted if network delivery lands immediately after it.
- Attempt Start/End FIFO entries are no longer erased when polling reaches `ROUND_RESULT`, `DEATHMATCH_RESULT`, `MATCH_RESULT`, or spectator state before their ACKs.
- PlayLayer now journals an outstanding visual attempt before automatic scene exit, closing another path where local progress/Clear could disappear before authoritative submission.
- Match dismissal / Queue Again waits for pending attempt transport instead of throwing away unsynchronized result events.
- Added server timing regression tests for bounded client timestamps and the transport-settling window.
